    <h4>Cook time: 40 min</h4>
    <p>These simple drop cookies give your oven a break:
        they start on the stovetop – where all the ingredients
        are mixed – and then finish and set in the fridge.
        They are also perfect for making with kids:
        all of the ingredients are pantry staples,
        clean-up is easy and there are no raw eggs.
        If your household has allergy concerns,
        then swap the peanut butter out with your
        favorite smooth nut or seed butter like almond,
        cashew or sunflower butter. Refrigerate the cookies
        in an airtight container and have chilled treats
        for after school or as special snacks.
        This recipe also makes a generous amount
        of cookies <em>(5 dozen!)</em> so keep it in mind the next
        time you need a giftable sweet.</p>
