    <h4>Cook time: 20 min</h4>
    <p>I could serve pasta at every meal and my family would not complain. Especially if that pasta happens to be this
        simple but delicious Parmesan Noodles recipe. These noodles remind me of some of those box noodle mixes you find
        at the store but instead, they're made completely from scratch in about 20 minutes. They are packed with
        irresistible garlic Parmesan flavor!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces dry linguine pasta</li>
        <li>1/2 cup reserved pasta water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup 2% milk</li>
        <li>1/3 cup finely shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 to 2 tablespoons fresh chopped italian parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven or pasta pot, cook the pasta in boiling water, salted water 1 minute shy of the package
            directions. Measure out and reserve Â½ cup of the starchy pasta water then drain the pasta in a colander and
            set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in the warm empty pot over MEDIUM-LOW heat. When melted, add the garlic and cook, stirring
            for a minute or two until fragrant. Sprinkle the flour over the butter and garlic and whisk for a minute or
            two.</li>
        <li>Whisk in a splash of the milk until well combined then slowly pour in the remaining milk, whisking well as
            you add it. Add about 2 tablespoons of the reserved pasta water and whisk again to combine. Cook, whisking
            occasionally, for a minute or two to thicken the mixture.</li>
        <li>Stir in the Parmesan, salt, and pepper. If cooked pasta is sticky, run water over it in the colander to
            loosen it up and then add it to the pot and toss with tongs until well combined. Add the parsley and toss
            again. If the mixture seems to thick, add as much additional pasta water as needed to reach desired
            consistency.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
